# Dictionary Web App


This is a dictionary web app built with React and Tailwind CSS. It is an intermediate challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL). With this app, you can easily search for words, listen to audio pronunciations, and switch between different fonts and themes.

## Demo
You can try out the app live by visiting this link: https://dictionary-web-app-v1.netlify.app/


### Tech Stack
  * React
  * Tailwind CSS
  * Axios
  * React-icons

## Features

* Search for words: The app has an input field that allows users to search for words. Once the user types in a word and hits the "Enter" key, the app fetches the definition of the word from an API and displays it on the screen.

* Form validation: If the user tries to submit a blank form, the app will display a form validation message asking the user to input a word.

* Audio files: If an audio file is available for a word, the user can click on the speaker icon to listen to the pronunciation of the word.

* Font switching: The app allows users to switch between different font types such as serif, sans-serif, and monospace. 

* Theme switching: Users can also switch between light and dark themes using the toggle button.
